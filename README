We have left the yeemacs and yeet executables already compiled in this directory
in case there are any issues with libraries not being present on the system,
in particular gtk-3 and gtksourceview-3 should be present for correct compilation.

For the best experience, we recommend first looking at the documentation files
in the 'documentation' directory.
